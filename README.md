Data Preparation: The Foundation for Any Successful Analysis, and Python is Your Most Powerful Tool!

In a world increasingly dependent on data, proper data preparation is key to achieving accurate and actionable analyses. Here, we use Python to transform raw data from multiple sources into a comprehensive, ready-to-analyze dataset. Letâ€™s take a closer look at what the code does:

1. Data Cleaning and Transformation:

The energy and GDP data are loaded from Excel and CSV files.

Columns containing unnecessary information like numbers or duplicate values are cleaned, and country names are standardized to avoid any data discrepancies.

Missing values are handled, and the "Energy Supply" units are converted to gigajoules to ensure analysis precision.



2. Merging Data from Multiple Sources:

The code merges energy, GDP, and scientific research data into a single unified dataset.

This merging provides a comprehensive view of the relationship between energy, economy, and scientific research at the country level.



3. Adding New Columns for Advanced Analysis:

%Renewable>Avg: A new column that indicates whether a country's renewable energy percentage is above the global average.

Citations%: A column that shows the percentage of self-citations compared to total citations for each country, revealing which countries rely most on their own research.

Area (Continents): A new column that associates each country with its respective continent, making continent-level analysis easier.



4. Additional Column Cleaning:

The code further cleans columns containing unnecessary data like numbers beside country names or long texts that might obstruct analysis. This ensures analysts can focus solely on the essential data.



5. Renewable Energy and Citation Analysis:

The code identifies the country with the highest percentage of renewable energy use and the country with the highest self-citation percentage relative to total citations.



6. Statistical Analysis at the Continent Level:

In the end, the code creates a dataset that includes continents, the number of countries per continent, total population, average population, and the standard deviation of population. This allows for a deeper understanding of the distribution of populations and resources across continents.




The result? A clean, information-rich dataset that is primed for detailed analysis, enabling informed decision-making based on reliable data.
